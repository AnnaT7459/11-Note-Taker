# Note Taker

## Description
If I were a small business owner, I would want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete. While developing the backend of this project, I learned a lot about linking html pages together, and creating functions to have the new notes being read, having the values be parsed into a json file, and then have it post to add the note to the UI. I was also able to find sources to create a function to delete a note for the bonus. With assistance from a tutor, J. Torres, I was able to learn by explaining the code as it is followed.

## Installation
You will need to have Express.js installed within the integrated terminal of VS Code.

## Usage
Run server.js and click the link to the local host. Then you will be able to add a title for a note and the text for the note. Then you click the save button and it will appear on the left-hand column. You can add multiple notes, clear notes if you decide not to make the note, and delete notes.
